        <p>It can be difficult to start learning how to program, especially given how vast of a field computer science is. For beginners,
        it's not uncommon to be overwhelmed with questions like "what language do I start with?" or "how do I actually start coding?" 
        Those who know <i>some</i> coding may wonder, "What should I learn next?" The goal of this blog post is to provide a 
        brief overview of important CS topics that will hopefully answer some of these questions as well as provide new programmers a 
        roadmap of topics for future self-study. 
        <br><br>
        We will be covering programming languages, text editors and IDEs, debuggers, version control, and the command
        line. If you're not a complete beginner, you can probably skip the first 2-3 topics, which are meant for people with no CS
        experience whatsoever. The remaining topics are things that aren't frequently covered in intro CS courses but are in fact
        very important skills for programmers to know. While it's impossible to fully cover any of these in a single blog post,
        it will hopefully provide you a detailed overview and set you up with an idea of what topics to pursue later on. So without
        further ado, let's begin!</p>

        <h2>Programming languages</h2>
        <p>One of the first questions that one asks when beginning to learn programming is what language they should start with. At
        this point, the most common response you'll get is that it doesn't matter. There are many reasons for this. One is that
        most languages aren't inherently better or worse than others; each has pros and cons, but choosing a language generally
        won't limit the type of programs you can create with it (e.g. Python can be used for web development, data
        visualization, scripting, etc.). Another is that after learning the fundamentals of computing in one language, switching
        to another is as simple as memorizing a slightly different set of syntax. For example, after learning French, it's not
        too difficult to learn Spanish, as both languages share some common rules and practices.
        <br><br>
        Nevertheless, below I've listed details about several popular languages and the use cases of each:
        <br><br>
        Java: Java is the chosen language for AP Computer Science taught in high schools and often used in intro college classes
        as well. Its frequently used for web development.
        <br><br>
        Python: generally regarded as a good beginner language due to its simple syntax. Can be used in areas such as data
        visualization/science and web development.
        <br><br>
        C/C++: two "low-level" languages in that they're useful for creating things like compilers? or programs that require
        speed and precision
        <br><br>
        JavaScript: despite its name, it's not at all related to Java. It's run in web browsers (e.g. Chrome) and is used in a
        huge number of websites on the front end (whereas languages like Java and Python would be considered backend languages,
        being run on a server)
        <br><br>
        Once you pick a language, it's time to start coding. To code, you most likely need to use a text editor or IDE
        (integrated development environment).</p>
        
        <h2>Text editors and IDEs</h2>
        <p>You can think of text editors as Word or Google Docs for code, usually providing useful tools like syntax highlighting
        or code completion. Most of these are programs you download onto your computer (some come with a default text editor,
        like NotePad++ on Windows), but you can also find websites that let you write and edit code online. Popular text editors
        include Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.
        <br><br>
        IDEs are just like text editors but typically heavier duty. XCode, IntelliJ, Visual Studio (not to be confused with
        Visual Studio Code), and Eclipse are all popular IDEs. They contain advanced features like debuggers and version
        control.</p>
        
        <h2>Debuggers</h2>
        <p>Debuggers are very useful for when something has gone wrong with your code. Maybe your code doesn't do as expected,
        shows an error such as ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, or simply runs infinitely. A debugger allows you to walk through
        your program line by line, seeing what's going on internally and helping you find any bugs. By setting "breakpoints" at
        certain lines, your program will run normally and then pause once it hits a breakpoint, giving you full control as you
        traverse your program. Although they may seem intimidating, they're quite easy to learn, and using them can save you a
        lot of time when writing your first few programs.</p>
        
        <h2>Version control</h2>
        <p>Version control is kind of like Google Docs, which allows multiple people to work on a single document and saves all
        edits into its history. Both of these things are important when coding, and as such, version control is definitely
        something to look into as you pursue programming further. There are many version control "systems" and hosting
        providers, but today I'll be focusing on Git and GitHub, the most popular of them all.
        <br><br>
        First, GitHub is a code hosting platform that allows you collaborate with other programmers, show off your code/software
        to others, or simply keep store your code files for safe-keeping. You create "repositories" to store your code; for
        example, you might have one repository for your computer course's homework assignments and another repository for a 2D
        shooter game your building. If you make your repository public, others can freely submit code changes that you can
        choose whether to approve and "merge" into your "master" repository. For both public and private repositories, you can
        also add collaborators who have access to make changes without your approval.
        <br><br>
        Unlike Google Docs, you can't edit these repositories live. Instead, what people most commonly do is to pair GitHub with
        Git, a version control system that's set up on one's computer. To make changes to a repository on GitHub, you can copy,
        or clone, the files in the repository onto your computer using Git. Then, using a text editor or IDE, you can add, edit,
        or delete whatever you want, and when your done, you can save these changes in a "commit," which is similar to creating
        a snapshot of your changes that you can revert to at any time. Finally, you can "push" the snapshots you make back up to
        GitHub, and programmers who have their own copies of the repository on GitHub can "pull" the changes you made onto their
        computer to stay up to date with the latest version of the codebase. Thus, through Git and GitHub, you can collaborate
        on coding projects as well as have a detailed history of the project through commits.
        <br><br>
        This is all a simplified explanation, but how do you actually "clone," "commit," "push," or "pull" as described? One way
        is to use the built-in version control functionality that comes with many IDEs, as mentioned above. These IDEs handle
        the git operations behind the scenes, instead presenting you with a graphical interface to do these operations. As a
        result, pulling and pushing can be as simple as clicking a button, and committing is just a matter of typing a
        description of your changes into a text box and clicking enter. The other main way is to directly use the git operations
        in a command line interface.</p>
        
        <h2>Command line</h2>
        <p>The command line is an alternative way to interact with your computer. Most people use a graphical interface, which is
        essentially all the apps and functionality you have on your computer with a UI (web browsers, file explorer, etc.). With
        the command line, you type in commands to interact with your computer rather than clicking or dragging and dropping. On
        macOS and Linux, you type these commands into an app called Terminal, whereas for Windows, you use an app called Command
        Prompt. For example, to list files in the current folder, you can type the command <code>ls</code> (or <code>dir</code>
        on Windows, which uses a different system). To change folders (or directories), type <code>cd foldername</code>, where
        cd stands for "change directory." If you have Git on your computer, running git operations is just like running any
        other command: <code>git pull</code>, <code>git push</code>, etc.
        <br><br>
        Although it seems insane that anyone would use the command line instead of a graphical user interface, it's actually
        very common among programmers and definitely an important topic to learn. More powerful capabilities and faster
        execution are just a few of its benefits over graphical user interfaces.
        <br><br>
        Of course, it's difficult to memorize all the different commands. If you need help keeping track of them all and use a Mac,
        go to our <a href="/">home page</a> to try out Bidbar, a snippet manager that also allows you to run or copy the commands
        you save using keyboard shortcuts.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While I definitely wouldn't expect any new programmer to delve into these topics all at once, I think it's helpful to at
        least familiarize oneself with them on a broad level. As you continue to learn programming, getting a head start in these
        areas will give you a leg up in pursuing an education in computer science. And don't worry if you didn't fully
        understand everything explained here; it will all make sense eventually!</p>
